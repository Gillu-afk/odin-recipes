    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy sausage pasta is my take on Pasta alla Norcina which is popular in Umbria. With just a few ingredients, it's simple and hearty, yet elegant enough for company.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>5 fluid ounces white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio</li>
        <li>5 ounces heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces penne or rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>fresh parsley, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot salted water to a boil and cook pasta until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and then sausage. Cook sausage, breaking it up with a spatula until it starts to brown, about 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add garlic and a little more olive oil if skillet seems dry. Pour in wine, and use a spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. </li>
        <li>Simmer until wine has reduced by about half; add pasta water and half the Parmesan. Stir, then add cream. Stir again, season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for a minute, then stir in pasta. Check for seasoning, then add in remaining Parmesan. Stir well and serve sprinkled with parsley. </li>

    </ol>
